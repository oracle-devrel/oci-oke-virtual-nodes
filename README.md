## Introduction
OKE virtual nodes deliver a complete serverless Kubernetes experience. With virtual nodes, you can ensure reliable operations of Kubernetes at scale without needing to manage any worker node infrastructure. Virtual nodes provides granular pod-level elasticity and pay-per-pod pricing, while eliminating the operational overhead of managing, scaling, upgrading, and troubleshooting worker nodesâ€™ infrastructure. 

OKE virtual nodes does not currently support all specs in deployment manifests. For more information, refer to [Virtual Nodes and Virtual Node Pools](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcomparingvirtualwithmanagednodes_topic.htm#contengcomparingvirtualwithmanagednodes_topic-virtualnodes). This repository includes modified manifests for common software packages and examples of deployments.

## Deployment of common software packages
### Deploy metrics server in a cluster with virtual nodes
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/main/metrics-server/components.yml
```
### Deploy Nginx Ingress Controller in a cluster with virtual nodes
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/main/ingress-nginx/deploy.yaml
```
### Deploy the dashboard in a cluster with virtual nodes using:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/main/kubernetes-dashboard/recommended.yaml
```
Refer to the [detailed instructions](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/blob/main/kubernetes-dashboard/README.md) to access the dashboard.

## Deployment examples
### Nginx with a service type load balancer exposed on port TCP/80
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/main/nginx-svc/nginx.yaml
```
### Pod with a sidecar that sends logs on a flat file to a persistent location such as Opensearch.
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-devrel/oci-oke-virtual-nodes/main/date-logging.yaml
```

# Prerequisites
- You have an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account. Get started with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure today with our [Oracle Cloud Free Trial](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).
- A Kubernetes cluster is created with Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). For more information, refer to [Creating Kubernetes Clusters](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengcreatingclusterusingoke.htm).
- The Kubeconfig file is configured to access the Kubernetes cluster. For more information, refer to [Accessing a Cluster Using Kubectl](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengaccessingclusterkubectl.htm).
